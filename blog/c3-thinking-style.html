    <p>
    Late one night, I caught a discussion on public TV between two scientists and a moderator. Their topic was the evolution of man and at some point of the discussion both scientists explained and agreed that what was most important for evolution to happen wasn’t intelligence but communication. That stuck with me and, as it happens, I found it to be true even in my own personal life: the relationships with a deteriorating communication were the ones that suffered the most.

	I took a Gregorc-based personal thinking style quiz only to find out that my own method of learning and thinking is the so-called Abstract Random (AR) way. The ‘abstract’ aspect refers to perception, while the ‘random’ aspect references the ordering ability of the brain. Admittedly, this is my first time I learned this about myself and has put me in an observation mode of how I take information in.  
	</p>
	<p>
	I believe that within the DBC environment, being a whole new arena to me, in order to best navigate it and benefit from it I would be putting my best foot forward: communication.
