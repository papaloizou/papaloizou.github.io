      Much like it sounds, a version control is a system that controls various versions of a file. With a version control you can record changes done to a file or set of files at any given moment and also be able to pull previous versions for reference. This practice makes up for a more cohesive and efficient workflow, especially when there are multiple people working on a single project.

        Once you make changes to a file and save them, they are then automatically tracked. Inside your terminal you can type the command “git status” and you will retrieve one or more of these following categories:
        Changes not staged for commit
        Changes to be committed
        Untracked files (in case of a new file).
        If there were no changes made, then you would get a message saying that there is nothing to commit and that your working directory is clean.

        Storing your code in GitHub has its undoubted practical benefits. Sure enough, one can just store one’s code locally on the computer but with GitHub you have an opportunity to expand beyond a singular mode of working and actually participate in a network with like-minded peers with whom you can share information. GitHub is that needed social coding platform for web developers to share their code, give and receive feedback, keep track of progress, changes and create backups.
