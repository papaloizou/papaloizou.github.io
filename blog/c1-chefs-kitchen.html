  <h1>My first reflections and impressions of DBC</h1>
  <h2>The subtitle, if you want it</h2>
  <h4>Saturday, May 23rd, 2015</h4>

      The DBC experience is all immersive: you commit your knowledge to expand it, you commit your mind to get through it, and you commit your spirit to fully experience it.
      I have never gone through a bootcamp of any sort; I have just experienced, second-hand, friends who ran marathons or triathlons. During their prep periods or during the actual marathon/triathlon, one thing would always humble me: the commitment and the tenacity involved. DBC seems to be exactly that: an intensive course that will be calling on all of your educational and interpersonal skillsâ€”kind of like in a video game where you reach a tough stage and you need to bring up all your best tools in order to go through it successfully.

        Upon deciding whether to join DBC, I had the chance to visit the onsite offices (here in NYC) and met and spoke to several people who gladly shared their DBC experience with me. Those short conversations alone made me start thinking that I can see myself in this environment, where I will be learning a vital language and meeting many new people. Additionally, being in the actual DBC space helped me remain realistic of what my expectations from this experience should be and what to anticipate. I believe this experience made it easier for me because it wasn't just a written idea (something I would read up online) but rather a reality within which I begun envisioning myself.

        I am certainly excited to join this type of learning environment and to observe how it will develop my skills and knowledge. Naturally, there is nervousness involved but nothing too obstructive to stop the flow from coming.
