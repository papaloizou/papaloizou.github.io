      Difference between Margin, Border, and Padding
    </p>
    <p>
      Let's imagine I have my book placed on an empty small table surface. And let's say (for the purposes of a more concrete visual) the small table is wooden and the book is James Joyce's Ulysses, a clean-cut version with just the letters on its cover.

      In this scenario, Margin is the distance between the edges of the small table to the edge of the book (e.g. the exposed wooden surface surrounding the book). Then, Border is the actual edge of the book (all around). And finally, Padding is the distance between the edge of the book to the beginning of the letters "James Joyce's Ulysses" (e.g. the part of the cover that is not written on).
