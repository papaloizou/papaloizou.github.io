      Let's imagine I have my book placed on an empty small table surface. And let's say (for the purposes of a more concrete visual) the small table is wooden and the book is James Joyce's Ulysses, a clean looking cover with just the letters on it.

      In this scenario, Margin is the distance between the edges of the small table to the edge of the book (e.g. the exposed wooden surface surrounding the book). Then the Border is the actual edge of the book (all around). And finally, Padding is the distance between the edge of the book to the beginning of the letters "James Joyce's Ulysses" (e.g. the part of the cover that is not written on and that surrounds the letters).
